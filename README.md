# ParallelProgrammingProject

This repo is used as my parallel programming project. There will be 3 programs
written using MPI, 3 written using OpenMP, and 1 using Hadoop MapReduce.

## OpenMP part

- Monte Carlo algorithm

I choose to implement Miller-Robin primality test. Miller-Robin test is a well-known
method to test whether a number is a prime or not. It belongs to Monte Carlo methods.
